Paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin introduces magnetic susceptibility to venous vessels in the brain, causing intra-voxel dephasing of surrounding tissue, resulting in veins appearing dark on a susceptibility-weighted image (SWI). This contrast allows us to segment vessels and estimate venous diameter from SWI. However, empirical studies quantifying the extent of this dephasing in straight sinus and internal cerebral veins are lacking. It is currently unknown how far ‘apparent diameters’ estimated from SWI images deviate from true diameters. To address this, we use non-saturated time-of-flight (TOF) angiogram as ground truth and quantify the extent to which apparent diameters estimated from SWI deviated from true (TOF) vessel diameters in a group of healthy subjects. We find that SWI vessels over-estimate true diameters by up to 40% in straight sinus and internal cerebral vein. As a control, we perform further experiments on the anterior cerebral artery where deoxyhemoglobin should be much lower, finding much closer correspondence between apparent diameters and ground truth (~15% over-estimation by SWI).
